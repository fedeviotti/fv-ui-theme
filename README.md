# fv-ui-theme

A library of ui components based on Material UI. It provides a set of reusable components that can be easily integrated into your projects to enhance the user interface and user experience.
It's tree-shakeable, meaning you can import only the components you need, reducing the bundle size of your application.
It exports the typescript types for all components, making it easier to work with TypeScript in your projects.
